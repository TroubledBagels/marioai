# Mario AI

This is my implementation of an AI to play Super Mario Bros. (SMB). It uses an evolving neural network with various mutations and mutation rates (see config.json) to create a learning mechanism that should (hopefully) learn how to play SMB.

Uses:
- Bizhawk emulator (allow Lua scripting)
- Python3 (for the NN server)
- Luasockets (for connecting to the server)
- Python sockets (for conencting to the Lua)

## Usage

Not fully complete - will list here once done.
